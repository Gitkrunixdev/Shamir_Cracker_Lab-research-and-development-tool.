## 🧠 Overview

Shamir_Cracker_Lab is a full-stack cryptographic toolkit designed for secure recovery, analysis, and visualization of secrets using Shamir’s Secret Sharing (RFC 2406). It includes CLI agents for brute-force reconstruction, monometric decoding, password recovery, and threshold analysis — optimized for blockchain-integrated environments.

## 🛠️ CLI Agents

| Agent Name         | Functionality                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `decode-monometric`| Heuristic recovery of damaged shares   |
| `threshold-analyze`| Validates share integrity and quorum   |
| `seed-reconstruct` | Rebuilds original seed from fragments  |
| `recover-password` | Reconstructs lost passwords via Shamir shares  
| `wallet-unlock`    | CLI-based wallet access recovery  
| `fullstack-deploy` | Deploys CLI tooling across chains      

Each agent supports modular export formats (JSON, SVG, PDF) and integrates with GUI dashboards or investor-facing visualizations.
