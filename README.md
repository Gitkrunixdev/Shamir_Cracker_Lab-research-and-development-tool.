# 🔐 Gitkrunixdev — Cryptographic CLI Tooling

**Gitkrunixdev** is a development-focused fork of the original `krunixbase` project, providing **audit-grade CLI tooling** for cryptographic recovery, seed reconstruction, and Shamir-based secret analysis in blockchain and regulated environments.

This repository is designed for **developers, security researchers, auditors, and Web3 infrastructure teams** requiring deterministic, inspectable, and compliance-ready recovery workflows.

---

## 🧭 Project Origin

This repository is forked from:

> **krunixbase**  
> Original author: **@shamircrackerlab**  
> https://github.com/krunixbase/krunixbase  
> Contact: https://x.com/shamircrackerlab

The fork preserves the original architectural intent while extending the tooling for **development, experimentation, and institutional integration** under the Gitkrunixdev namespace.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Gitkrunixdev builds upon **Shamir’s Secret Sharing** mechanisms to deliver modular CLI agents capable of:

- Secure seed and password reconstruction
- Threshold and quorum validation
- Share integrity analysis
- Blockchain-integrated recovery workflows
- Exportable audit artifacts (JSON, SVG, PDF)

All tooling is designed to be **transparent, reproducible, and suitable for forensic or compliance review**.

## 🛠️ Core CLI Agents

| Agent Name              | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `decode-monometric`     | Heuristic recovery of damaged or incomplete shares |
| `threshold-analyze`     | Validates quorum, share integrity, and reconstruction feasibility |
| `seed-reconstruct`      | Deterministic reconstruction of original seed material |
| `recover-password`     | Password recovery using Shamir-based fragments |
| `wallet-unlock`         | CLI-based wallet access recovery |
| `fullstack-deploy`      | Deploys CLI tooling across supported blockchain environments |

Each agent supports **modular output formats** and can be embedded into automated pipelines or GUI dashboards.

---

## 🧪 Experimental & Development Modules

The Gitkrunixdev fork introduces experimental agents and variants intended for testing and prototyping:

- `wallet-unlock-dev` — sandboxed wallet recovery for testnets
- `seed-reconstruct-lite` — optimized for mobile and offline environments
- `threshold-analyze-viz` — SVG-based quorum visualization for audit reports

> ⚠️ Experimental modules are **not production-certified** and should be used in controlled environments only.

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- Blockchain wallet recovery for DAOs and custodial services
- Seed reconstruction during legal or compliance audits
- Forensic analysis of partial or corrupted backups
- CLI tooling for regulated Web3 custody environments
- Educational and research use in cryptographic recovery systems

---

## 📦 Output & Integration

All agents are designed to integrate with:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Compliance and audit tooling
- Investor-facing dashboards
- Offline and air-gapped environments

Supported export formats include:
- JSON
- SVG
- PDF
